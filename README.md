# question-answering-bot
 Question Answering BOT made with pretrained BERT, PruneBERT, DistilBERT, BioBERT models.

### You need to install certain versions
First of all. python cannot be newer than 3.7.6
```
pip install torch==1.7.1+cpu torchvision==0.8.2+cpu torchaudio===0.7.2 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
pip install transformers==3
pip install pyqt5
```

Than you can easily run
```
python main.py
```

An easy to use (but laggy) GUI will pop up in a short time. First run of each model could take a little while to load, which you can track from you terminal.
